# MusicPlayer
Simple demo of creating a music player using a Service

The "master" branch contains skeleton code, so we can walk through the implementation.

The "serviceImpl" branch implements the service. It should be roughly what we walk through in class.

The "foreground" branch turns the service into a foreground service and displays a notification.

The song used in the demo is Povo Que Caís Descalço by Dead Combo (downloaded from [The Free Music Archive](https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Dead_Combo/Creative_Commons_The_2015_Unofficial_Mixtape/01_Povo_Que_Cais_Descalco)).
